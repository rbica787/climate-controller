# climate-controller
This is a controller for regulating the humidity within a small storage space

I have to admit, there are a lot of things I would have done differently if I were to start it again.
I plan to make a 2.0 version, when I get the time, and completely revise all of my hardware/software regrets.

I should mention that I also intended to add some kind of heater control as well, but I've decided that
It's really not necessary for my circumstance.
